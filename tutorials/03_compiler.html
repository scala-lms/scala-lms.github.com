      <h1>(Chapter 0) Intro: Not your Grandfather's Compiler</h1>
<p><a name="chap:300"></a></p>
<p>This part discusses compiler internals.  How do embedded compilers compile
<br  />their programs?</p>
<p>Outline:</p>
<div id="tableofcontents"></div>
<p>The purely string based representation of staged programs from <a href="02_basics.html">Part <br  />2</a> does  not allow analysis or transformation of embedded
<br  />programs. Since LMS is not inherently tied to a particular program
<br  />representation it is very easy to pick one that is better suited for
<br  />optimization. As a first cut, we switch to an intermediate representation (IR)
<br  />based on expression trees, adding a level of indirection  between construction
<br  />of object programs and code generation (see <a href="#chap:310trees">below</a>). On this
<br  />tree IR we can define traversal and transformation passes and build a
<br  />straightforward embedded compiler. We can add new IR node types  and new
<br  />transformation passes that implement domain specific optimizations. In
<br  />particular we can use multiple passes of staging: While traversing
<br  />(effectively, interpreting) one IR we can execute staging commands to build
<br  />another staged program, possibly in a different,  lower-level object language.</p>
<p>However the extremely high degree of extensibility poses serious challenges.
<br  />In particular, the interplay of optimizations implemented as many separate
<br  />phases does not yield good results due to the phase ordering problem: It  is
<br  />unclear in which order and how often to execute these phases, and since each
<br  />optimization pass  has to make pessimistic assumptions about the outcome of
<br  />all other passes  the global result is often suboptimal compared to a
<br  />dedicated, combined  optimization phase
<br  /><a href="veldhuizen:combiningoptimizations,click95combineanalysis">(*)</a>.  There are
<br  />also implementation challenges as each optimization needs to be  designed to
<br  />treat unknown IR nodes in a sensible way.</p>
<p>Other challenges are due to the fact that embedded compilers are supposed to
<br  />be used like libraries. Extending an embedded compiler should be easy, and as
<br  />much of the work as possible should be delegated to a library of compiler
<br  />components. Newly defined high-level IR nodes should  profit from generic
<br  />optimizations automatically.</p>
<p>To remedy this situation, we switch to a graph-based ''sea of nodes''
<br  />representation (see <a href="#chap:320graphs">below</a>). This representation links
<br  />definitions and uses, and it also reflects the program block structure via
<br  />nesting edges. We consider purely functional programs first. A number of
<br  />nontrivial optimizations become considerably simpler. Common subexpression
<br  />elimination (CSE) and dead  code elimination (DCE) are particularly easy. Both
<br  />are completely generic and support an open domain of IR node types.
<br  />Optimizations that can be expressed as context-free rewrites are also easy to
<br  />add in a modular fashion. A scheduling and code motion algorithm transforms
<br  />graphs back into trees, moving  computations to places where they are less
<br  />often executed, e.g. out of loops or functions.  Both graph-based and tree-
<br  />based transformations are useful: graph-based transformations are usually
<br  />simpler and more efficient whereas tree-based  transformations, implemented as
<br  />multiple staging passes, can be more powerful and employ arbitrary context-
<br  />sensitive information.</p>
<p>To support effectful programs, we make effects explicit in the dependency
<br  />graph  (similar to SSA form). We can support simple effect domains (pure vs
<br  />effectful)  and more fine grained ones, such as tracking modifications per
<br  />allocation site.  The latter one relies on alias and points-to analysis.</p>
<p>We then turn to advanced optimizations (see <a href="#chap:330opt">below</a>). For
<br  />combining analyses and optimizations, it is crucial to maintain optimistic
<br  />assumptions for all analyses. The key challenge is that one analysis has to
<br  />anticipate the effects of the other transformations. The solution is
<br  />speculative rewriting <a href="lerner02composingdataflow">(*)</a>: transform a program
<br  />fragment  in the presence of partial and possibly unsound analysis results and
<br  />re-run the analyses on the transformed code until a fixpoint is reached. This
<br  />way, different analyses can communicate through the transformed code and  need
<br  />not anticipate their results in other ways. Using speculative rewriting, we
<br  />compose  many optimizations into more powerful combined passes. Often, a
<br  />single forward simplification pass that can be used to clean up after non-
<br  />optimizing  transformations is sufficient.</p>
<p>However not all rewrites can fruitfully be combined into a single phase. For
<br  />example, high-level representations of linear algebra operations may give rise
<br  />to rewrite rules like $I M \rightarrow M$ where $I$ is the identity matrix. At
<br  />the same time, there may be rules that define how a matrix multiplication can
<br  />be implemented in terms of arrays and while loops, or a call to an external
<br  />library (BLAS).  To be effective, all the high-level simplifications need to
<br  />be applied exhaustively before any of the lowering transformations are
<br  />applied. But lowering transformations may create new opportunities for high-
<br  />level rules, too. Our solution here is delayed rewriting: programmers can
<br  />specify that a  certain rewrite should not be applied right now, but have it
<br  />registered to be executed at the next iteration of a particular phase. Delayed
<br  />rewriting thus provides a way of grouping and prioritizing modularly defined
<br  />transformations.</p>
<p>On top of this infrastructure, we build a number of advanced optimizations. A
<br  />general pattern is split and merge: We split operations and data structures in
<br  />order to expose their components to rewrites and dead-code  elimination and
<br  />then merge the remaining parts back together. This struct transformation  also
<br  />allows for more general data structure conversions, including array-of-struct
<br  />to struct-of-array representation conversion. Furthermore we present a novel
<br  />loop fusion algorithm, a powerful transformation that removes intermediate
<br  />data structures.</p>
<h1>(Chapter 1) Intermediate Representation: Trees</h1>
<p>\label{chap:310trees}</p>
<p>With the aim of generating code, we could represent staged expressions
<br  />directly as strings, as done in <a href="02_basics.html">Part 2</a>. But for optimization
<br  />purposes we would rather have a structured intermediate representation that we
<br  />can analyze in various ways. Fortunately, LMS makes it very easy to use a
<br  />different internal program representation.</p>
<h1>Trees Instead of Strings</h1>
<p>\label{sec:301}</p>
<p>Our starting point is an object language <em>interface</em> derived from
<br  /><a href="02_basics.html">Part 2</a>:</p>
<pre><code>trait Base {
  type Rep[T]
}
trait Arith extends Base {
  def infix_+(x: Rep[Double], y: Rep[Double]): Rep[Double]
  def infix_*(x: Rep[Double], y: Rep[Double]): Rep[Double]
  ...
}
trait IfThenElse extends Base  {
  def __ifThenElse[T](c: Rep[Boolean], a: =&gt;Rep[T], b: =&gt;Rep[T]): Rep[T]
}
</code></pre>
<p>The goal will be to build a corresponding <em>implementation</em> hierarchy that
<br  />supports optimizing compilation.</p>
<p>Splitting interface and implementation has many advantages, most importantly a
<br  />clear separation between the user program world and the compiler
<br  />implementation world.  For the sake of completeness, let us briefly recast the
<br  />string representation  in this model:</p>
<pre><code>trait BaseStr extends Base {
  type Rep[T] = String
}
trait ArithStr extends BaseStr with Arith {
  def infix_+(x: Rep[Double], y: Rep[Double]) = perform(x + " + " + y)
  def infix_*(x: Rep[Double], y: Rep[Double]) = perform(x + " * " + y)
  ...
}
trait IfThenElseStr extends BaseStr with IfThenElse  {
  def __ifThenElse[T](c: Rep[Boolean], a: =&gt;Rep[T], b: =&gt;Rep[T]) =
    perform("if (" + c + ") " + accumulate(a) + " else " + accumulate(b))
}
</code></pre>
<p>In this chapter, we will use an IR that is based on expression trees, closely
<br  />resembling the abstract syntax tree (AST) of a staged program. This
<br  />representation enables separate analysis,  optimization and code generation
<br  />passes. We will use the following types:</p>
<pre><code>type Exp[T]     // atomic:     Sym, Const
type Def[T]     // composite:  Exp + Exp, Exp * Exp, ...
type Stm[T]     // statement:  val x = Def
type Block[T]   // blocks:     { Stm; ...; Stm; Exp }
</code></pre>
<p>They are defined as follows in a separate trait:</p>
<pre><code>trait Expressions {
  // expressions (atomic)
  abstract class Exp[T]
  case class Const[T](x: T) extends Exp[T]
  case class Sym[T](n: Int) extends Exp[T]
  def fresh[T]: Sym[T]

  // definitions (composite, subclasses provided by other traits)
  abstract class Def[T]

  // statements
  case class Stm[T](sym: Sym[T], rhs: Def[T])

  // blocks
  case class Block[T](stms: Stm[_], res: Exp[T])

  // perform and accumulate
  def reflectStm[T](d: Stm[T]): Exp[T]
  def reifyBlock[T](b: =&gt;Exp[T]): Block[T]

  // bind definitions to symbols automatically
  // by creating a statement
  implicit def toAtom[T](d: Def[T]): Exp[T] =
    reflectStm(Stm(fresh[T], d))
}
</code></pre>
<p>This trait <code>Expressions</code> will be mixed in at the root of the object language
<br  />implementation hierarchy. The guiding principle  is that each definition has
<br  />an associated symbol and refers to other definitions only via their symbols.
<br  />This means that every  composite value will be named, similar to
<br  />administrative normal form (ANF). Methods <code>reflectStm</code> and <code>reifyBlock</code> take
<br  />over the responsibility of <code>perform</code>  and <code>accumulate</code>.</p>
<h2>Modularity: Adding IR Node Types</h2>
<p>We observe that there are no concrete definition classes provided by trait
<br  /><code>Expressions</code>. Providing meaningful data types is the responsibility of other
<br  />traits that implement the interfaces defined previously (<code>Base</code> and its
<br  />descendents).</p>
<p>Trait <code>BaseExp</code> forms the root of the implementation hierarchy and installs
<br  />atomic expressions as the representation of staged values by defining
<br  /><code>Rep[T] = Exp[T]</code>:</p>
<pre><code>trait BaseExp extends Base with Expressions {
  type Rep[T] = Exp[T]
}
</code></pre>
<p>For each interface trait, there is one corresponding core implementation
<br  />trait. Shown below, we have traits <code>ArithExp</code> and <code>IfThenElseExp</code> as the
<br  />running example.  Both traits define one definition class for each operation
<br  />defined by <code>Arith</code> and <code>IfThenElse</code>, respectively, and implement the
<br  />corresponding interface methods to create instances of those classes.</p>
<pre><code>trait ArithExp extends BaseExp with Arith {
  case class Plus(x: Exp[Double], y: Exp[Double]) extends Def[Double]
  case class Times(x: Exp[Double], y: Exp[Double]) extends Def[Double]
  def infix_+(x: Rep[Double], y: Rep[Double]) = Plus(x, y)
  def infix_*(x: Rep[Double], y: Rep[Double]) = Times(x, y)
  ...
}
trait IfThenElseExp extends BaseExp with IfThenElse {
  case class IfThenElse(c: Exp[Boolean], a: Block[T], b: Block[T]) extends Def[T]
  def __ifThenElse[T](c: Rep[Boolean], a: =&gt;Rep[T], b: =&gt;Rep[T]): Rep[T] =
    IfThenElse(c, reifyBlock(a), reifyBlock(b))
}
</code></pre>
<p>The framework ensures that code that contains staging operations will always
<br  />be executed within the dynamic scope of at least one invocation  of
<br  /><code>reifyBlock</code>, which returns a block object and takes as call-by-name argument
<br  />the present-stage expression  that will compute the staged block result. Block
<br  />objects can be part of definitions, e.g. for loops or conditionals.</p>
<p>Since all operations in interface traits such as <code>Arith</code> return <code>Rep</code> types,
<br  />equating <code>Rep[T]</code> and <code>Exp[T]</code> in trait <code>BaseExp</code> means that conversion to
<br  />symbols will take place already  within those methods. This fact is important
<br  />because it establishes our correspondence between the evaluation order of the
<br  />program generator and the evaluation order of the generated program: at the
<br  />point where the generator calls <code>toAtom</code>, the composite definition is turned
<br  />into an atomic value via <code>reflectStm</code>, i.e. its evaluation will be recorded
<br  />now and played back later in the same relative order with respect to others
<br  />within the closest <code>reifyBlock</code>  invocation.</p>
<h1>Enabling Analysis and Transformation</h1>
<p>Given our IR representation it is easy to add traversals and transformations.</p>
<h2>Modularity: Adding Traversal Passes</h2>
<p>All that is needed to define a generic in-order traversal is a way to access
<br  />all blocks immediately contained in a definition:</p>
<pre><code>def blocks(x: Any): List[Block[Any]]
</code></pre>
<p>For example, applying <code>blocks</code> to an <code>IfThenElse</code> node will return the then
<br  />and else blocks. Since definitions are case classes, this method is easy  to
<br  />implement by using the <code>Product</code> interface that all case classes implement.</p>
<p>The basic structural in-order traversal is then defined like this:</p>
<pre><code>trait ForwardTraversal {
  val IR: Expressions
  import IR._
  def traverseBlock[T](b: Block[T]): Unit = b.stms.foreach(traverseStm)
  def traverseStm[T](s: Stm[T]): Unit = blocks(s).foreach(traverseBlock)
}
</code></pre>
<p>Custom traversals can be implemented in a modular way by extending the
<br  /><code>ForwardTraversal</code> trait:</p>
<pre><code>trait MyTraversalBase extends ForwardTraversal {
  val IR: BaseExp
  import IR._
  override def traverseStm[T](s: Stm[T]) = s match {
    // custom base case or delegate to super
    case _ =&gt; super.traverseStm(s)
  }
}
trait MyTraversalArith extends MyTraversalBase {
  val IR: ArithExp
  import IR._
  override def traverseStm[T](s: Stm[T]) = s match {
    case Plus(x,y) =&gt; ... // handle specific nodes
    case _ =&gt; super.traverseStm(s)
  }
}
</code></pre>
<p>For each unit of functionality such as <code>Arith</code> or <code>IfThenElse</code> the traversal
<br  />actions can be defined separately as <code>MyTraversalArith</code> and
<br  /><code>MyTraversalIfThenElse</code>.</p>
<p>Finally, we can use our traversal as follows:</p>
<pre><code>trait Prog extends Arith {
  def main = ... // program code here
}
val impl = new Prog with ArithExp
val res = impl.reifyBlock(impl.main)
val inspect = MyTraversalArith { val IR: impl.type = impl }
inspect.traverseBlock(res)
</code></pre>
<h2>Solving the ''Expression Problem''</h2>
<p>In essence, traversals confront us with the classic ''expression problem'' of
<br  />independently extending a data model with new data variants and  new
<br  />operations <a href="wadlerExprProblem">(*)</a>. There are many solutions to this problem
<br  />but most of them are rather heavyweight. More lightweight implementations are
<br  />possible in languages that support  multi-methods, i.e. dispatch method calls
<br  />dynamically based on the actual types of all the arguments.  We can achieve
<br  />essentially the same using pattern matching and mixin composition, making use
<br  />of the fact  that composing traits is subject to linearization
<br  /><a href="DBLP:conf/oopsla/OderskyZ05">(*)</a>. We package each set of specific traversal
<br  />rules into its own trait, e.g. <code>MyTraversalArith</code> that inherits from
<br  /><code>MyTraversalBase</code> and overrides <code>traverseStm</code>. When the arguments do not match
<br  />the rewriting pattern, the overridden method will invoke the ''parent''
<br  />implementation using <code>super</code>. When several such traits are combined, the super
<br  />calls will traverse the overridden method implementations according to the
<br  />linearization order of their containing traits.  The use of pattern matching
<br  />and super calls is similar to earlier work on extensible algebraic data types
<br  />with defaults <a href="DBLP:conf/icfp/ZengerO01">(*)</a>, which supported linear
<br  />extensions but not composition of independent extensions.</p>
<p>Implementing multi-methods in a statically typed setting usually poses three
<br  />problems: separate type checking/compilation, ensuring non-ambiguity and
<br  />ensuring exhaustiveness. The described encoding supports separate
<br  />type-checking and compilation in as far as traits do. Ambiguity is ruled out
<br  />by always following the linearization order and the first-match semantics of
<br  />pattern matching. Exhaustiveness is ensured at the type level by requiring a
<br  />default implementation, although no guarantees can be made that the default
<br  />will not choose to throw an exception at runtime. In the particular case of
<br  />traversals, the default is always safe and will just continue the structural
<br  />traversal.</p>
<h2>Generating Code</h2>
<p>Code generation is just a traversal pass that prints code. Compiling and
<br  />executing code can use the same mechanism as described
<br  /><a href="#sec:230codegen">above</a>.</p>
<h2>Modularity: Adding Transformations</h2>
<p>Transformations work very similar to traversals. One option is to traverse and
<br  />transform an existing program more or less in place, not actually modifying
<br  />data  but attaching new Defs to existing Syms:</p>
<pre><code>trait SimpleTransformer {
  val IR: Expressions
  import IR._
  def transformBlock[T](b: Block[T]): Block[T] =
    Block(b.stms.flatMap(transformStm), transformExp(b.res))
  def transformStm[T](s: Stm[T]): List[Stm] =
    List(Stm(s.lhs, transformDef(s.rhs)))   // preserve existing symbol s
  def transformDef[T](d: Def[T]): Def[T]    // default: use reflection
                                            // to map over case classes
}
</code></pre>
<p>An implementation is straightforward:</p>
<pre><code>trait MySimpleTransformer extends SimpleTransformer {
  val IR: IfThenElseExp
  import IR._
  // override transformDef for each Def subclass
  def transformDef[T](d: Def[T]): Def[T] = d match {
    case IfThenElse(c,a,b) =&gt;
      IfThenElse(transformExp(c), transformBlock(a), transformBlock(b))
    case _ =&gt; super.transformDef(d)
  }
}
</code></pre>
<h2>Transformation by Iterated Staging</h2>
<p>\label{sec:310treeTrans}</p>
<p>Another option that is more principled and in line with the idea of making
<br  />compiler transforms programmable through the use of staging is to traverse the
<br  />old program and create a new program. Effectively we are implementing an IR
<br  />interpreter that executes staging commands, which greatly simplifies the
<br  />implementation of the transform and removes the need for low-level IR
<br  />manipulation.</p>
<p>In the implementation, we will create new symbols instead of reusing existing
<br  />ones so we need to maintain a substitution that maps old to new Syms. The core
<br  />implementation is given below:</p>
<pre><code>trait ForwardTransformer extends ForwardTraversal {
  val IR: Expressions
  import IR._
  var subst: Map[Exp[_],Exp[_]]
  def transformExp[T](s: Exp[T]): Exp[T] = ... // lookup s in subst
  def transformDef[T](d: Def[T]): Exp[T]       // default
  def transformStm[T](s: Stm[T]): Exp[T] = {
    val e = transformDef(s.rhs); subst += (s.sym -&gt; e); e
  }
  override def traverseStm[T](s: Stm[T]): Unit = {
    transformStm(s)
  }
  def reflectBlock[T](b: Block[T]): Exp[T] = withSubstScope {
    traverseBlock(b); transformExp(b.res)
  }
  def transformBlock[T](b: Block[T]): Block[T] = {
    reifyBlock(reflectBlock(b))
  }
}
</code></pre>
<p>Here is a simple identity transformer implementation for conditionals and
<br  />array construction:</p>
<pre><code>trait MyTransformer extends ForwardTransformer {
  val IR: IfThenElseExp with ArraysExp
  import IR._
  def transformDef[T](d: Def[T]): Exp[T] = d match {
    case IfThenElse(c,a,b) =&gt;
      __ifThenElse(transformExp(c), reflectBlock(a), reflectBlock(b))
    case ArrayFill(n,i,y) =&gt;
      arrayFill(transformExp(n), { j =&gt; withSubstScope(i -&gt; j) { reflectBlock(y) }})
    case _ =&gt; ...
  }
}
</code></pre>
<p>The staged transformer facility can be extended slightly to translate not only
<br  />within a single  language but also between two languages:</p>
<pre><code>trait FlexTransformer {
  val SRC: Expressions
  val DST: Base
  trait TypeTransform[A,B]
  var subst: Map[SRC.Exp[_],DST.Rep[_]]
  def transformExp[A,B](s: SRC.Exp[A])(implicit t: TypeTransform[A,B]): DST.Rep[B]
}
</code></pre>
<p>It is also possible to add more abstraction on top of the base transforms to
<br  />build  combinators for rewriting strategies in the style of Stratego
<br  /><a href="spoofax">(*)</a> or  Kiama <a href="DBLP:conf/gttse/Sloane09">(*)</a>.</p>
<h1>Problem: Phase Ordering</h1>
<p>This all works but is not completely satisfactory.  With fine grained separate
<br  />transformations we immediately run into phase ordering problems
<br  /><a href="veldhuizen:combiningoptimizations,click95combineanalysis">(*)</a>.  We could
<br  />execute optimization passes in a loop until we reach a fixpoint but even then
<br  />we may miss opportunities if the program contains loops. For best results,
<br  />optimizations need to be tightly integrated. Optimizations need a different
<br  />mechanisms than lowering transformations that have a clearly defined  before
<br  />and after model. In the next chapter, we will thus consider a slightly
<br  />different IR  representation.</p>
<h1>(Chapter 2) Intermediate Representation: Graphs</h1>
<p>\label{chap:320graphs}</p>
<p>To remedy phase ordering problems and overall allow for more flexibility in
<br  />rearranging program pieces,  we switch to a program representation based on
<br  />structured graphs. This representation is not to be confused with control-flow
<br  />graphs (CFGs): Since one of our main goals is parallelization, a sequential
<br  />CFG would not be a good fit.</p>
<h1>Purely Functional Subset</h1>
<p>\label{sec:303purefun}</p>
<p>Let us first consider a purely functional language subset. There are much more
<br  />possibilities for aggressive optimizations.  We can rely on referential
<br  />transparency: The value of an expression is always the same, no matter when
<br  />and where it is computed.  Thus, optimizations do not need to check
<br  />availability or lifetimes of expressions. Global common subexpression
<br  />elimination (CSE), pattern rewrites, dead code elimination (DCE) and code
<br  />motion are considerably simpler than the usual implementations for imperative
<br  />programs.</p>
<p>We switch to a ''sea of nodes''-like <a href="DBLP:conf/irep/ClickP95">(*)</a>
<br  />representation that is a directed  (and for the moment, acyclic) graph:</p>
<pre><code>trait Expressions {
  // expressions (atomic)
  abstract class Exp[T]
  case class Const[T](x: T) extends Exp[T]
  case class Sym[T](n: Int) extends Exp[T]
  def fresh[T]: Sym[T]

  // definitions (composite, subclasses provided by other traits)
  abstract class Def[T]

  // blocks -- no direct links to statements
  case class Block[T](res: Exp[T])

  // bind definitions to symbols automatically
  // by creating a statement
  implicit def toAtom[T](d: Def[T]): Exp[T] =
    reflectPure(d)

  def reifyBlock[T](b: =&gt;Exp[T]): Block[T]
  def reflectPure[T](d: Def[T]): Sym[T] =
    findOrCreateDefinition(d)

  def findDefinition[T](s: Sym[T]): Option[Def[T]]
  def findDefinition[T](d: Def[T]): Option[Sym[T]]
  def findOrCreateDefinition[T](d: Def[T]): Sym[T]
}
</code></pre>
<p>It is instructive to compare the definition of trait <code>Expressions</code> with the
<br  />one from the previous <a href="#chap:310trees">chapter</a>. Again there are three
<br  />categories of objects involved: expressions,  which are atomic (subclasses of
<br  /><code>Exp</code>: constants and symbols; with a ''gensym'' operator <code>fresh</code> to create
<br  />fresh symbols), definitions, which represent composite operations (subclasses
<br  />of <code>Def</code>, to be provided by other components), and blocks, which model nested
<br  />scopes.</p>
<p>Trait <code>Expressions</code> now provides methods to find a definition given a symbol
<br  />or vice versa.  Direct links between blocks and statements are removed. The
<br  />actual graph nodes are <code>(Sym[T], Def[T])</code> pairs. They need not be accessible
<br  />to clients at this level. Thus method <code>reflectStm</code> from the previous chapter
<br  />is replaced by <code>reflectPure</code>.</p>
<p>Graphs also carry nesting information (boundSyms, see below). This enables
<br  />code motion for different kinds of nested expressions such as lambdas, not
<br  />only for loops or conditionals. The structured graph representation is also
<br  />more appropriate for parallel execution than the traditional sequential
<br  />control-flow graph. Pure  computation can float freely in the graph and can be
<br  />scheduled for execution anywhere.</p>
<h1>Modularity: Adding IR Node Types</h1>
<p>The object language implementation code is the same compared to the tree
<br  />representation:</p>
<pre><code>trait BaseExp extends Base with Expressions {
  type Rep[T] = Exp[T]
}
</code></pre>
<p>Again, we have separate traits, one for each unit of functionality:</p>
<pre><code>trait ArithExp extends BaseExp with Arith {
  case class Plus(x: Exp[Double], y: Exp[Double]) extends Def[Double]
  case class Times(x: Exp[Double], y: Exp[Double]) extends Def[Double]
  def infix_+(x: Rep[Double], y: Rep[Double]) = Plus(x, y)
  def infix_*(x: Rep[Double], y: Rep[Double]) = Times(x, y)
  ...
}
trait IfThenElseExp extends BaseExp with IfThenElse {
  case class IfThenElse(c: Exp[Boolean], a: Block[T], b: Block[T]) extends Def[T]
  def __ifThenElse[T](c: Rep[Boolean], a: =&gt;Rep[T], b: =&gt;Rep[T]): Rep[T] =
    IfThenElse(c, reifyBlock(a), reifyBlock(b))
}
</code></pre>
<h1>Simpler Analysis and More Flexible Transformations</h1>
<p>Several optimizations are very simple to implement on this purely functional
<br  />graph IR. The implementation draws inspiration from previous work on compiling
<br  />embedded DSLs <a href="DBLP:conf/saig/ElliottFM00,DBLP:conf/dsl/LeijenM99">(*)</a> as
<br  />well as staged FFT kernels <a href="DBLP:conf/emsoft/KiselyovST04">(*)</a>.</p>
<h2>Common Subexpression Elimination/Global Value Numbering</h2>
<p>\label{sec:320cse}</p>
<p>Common subexpressions are eliminated during IR construction using hash
<br  />consing:</p>
<pre><code>def findOrCreateDefinition[T](d: Def[T]): Sym[T]
</code></pre>
<p>Invoked by <code>reflectPure</code> through the implicit conversion  method <code>toAtom</code>,
<br  />this method converts a definition to an atomic expression and links it to the
<br  />scope being built up by the innermost enclosing <code>reifyBlock</code> call. When the
<br  />definition is known to be side-effect free, it will search the already
<br  />encountered definitions for a structurally equivalent one.  If a matching
<br  />previous definition is found, its symbol will be returned, possibly moving the
<br  />definition to a parent scope to make it accessible.  If the definition may
<br  />have side effects or it is seen  for the first time, it will be associated
<br  />with a fresh symbol and saved for future reference.  This simple scheme
<br  />provides a powerful global value numbering optimization
<br  /><a href="DBLP:conf/pldi/Click95">(*)</a> that effectively prevents generating duplicate
<br  />code.</p>
<h2>Pattern Rewrites</h2>
<p>Using <code>findDefinition</code>, we can implement an extractor object
<br  /><a href="DBLP:conf/ecoop/EmirOW07">(*)</a> that enables pattern matching on a symbol to
<br  />lookup the underlying definition associated to the symbol:</p>
<pre><code>object Def {
  def unapply[T](s: Exp[T]): Option[Def[T]] = s match {
    case s: Sym[T] =&gt; findDefinition(s)
    case _ =&gt; None
  }
}
</code></pre>
<p>This extractor object can be used to implement smart
<br  />constructors for IR nodes that deeply inspect their arguments:</p>
<pre><code>def infix_*(x: Exp[Double], y: Exp[Double]) = (x,y) match {
  case (Const(x), Const(y)) =&gt; Const(x * y)
  case (Const(k), Def(Times(Const(l), y))) =&gt; Const(k * l) * y
  case _ =&gt; Times(x,y)
}

<p>Smart constructors are a simple yet powerful rewriting facility. If the smart
<br  />constructor is the only way to construct <code>Times</code> nodes we obtain a strong
<br  />guarantee: No <code>Times</code> node is ever created without applying all possible
<br  />rewrites first.</p>
<h2>Modularity: Adding new Optimizations</h2>
<p>\label{sec:308addOpts}</p>
<p>Some profitable optimizations, such as the global value numbering described
<br  />above, are very generic. Other optimizations apply only to specific aspects of
<br  />functionality, for example particular implementations of constant folding (or
<br  />more generally symbolic rewritings) such as replacing computations like
<br  /><code>x * 1.0</code> with <code>x</code>. Yet other optimizations are specific to the actual program
<br  />being staged. Kiselyov et al. <a href="DBLP:conf/emsoft/KiselyovST04">(*)</a> describe  a
<br  />number of rewritings that are particularly effective for the patterns of code
<br  />generated by a staged FFT algorithm but not as much for other programs. The
<br  />FFT example is discussed  in more detail <a href="#sec:Afft">here</a>.</p>
<p>What we want to achieve again is modularity, so that optimizations can be
<br  />combined in a way that is most useful for a given task.  To implement a
<br  />particular rewriting rule (whether specific or generic), say, <code>x * 1.0</code>
<br  />$\rightarrow$ <code>x</code>, we can provide a specialized implementation of <code>infix_*</code>
<br  />(overriding the one in trait <code>ArithExp</code>) that will test its arguments for a
<br  />particular pattern. How this can be done in a modular way is shown by the
<br  />traits <code>ArithExpOpt</code> and <code>ArithExpOptFFT</code>, which implement some generic and
<br  />program specific optimizations. Note that the use of <code>x*y</code> within the body of
<br  /><code>infix_*</code> will apply the optimization recursively.</p>
<p>The appropriate pattern is to override the smart constructor in a separate
<br  />trait and call the super implementation if no rewrite matches. This decouples
<br  />optimizations from node type definitions.</p>
<pre><code>trait ArithExpOpt extends ArithExp {
  override def infix_*(x:Exp[Double],y:Exp[Double]) = (x,y) match {
    case (Const(x), Const(y)) =&gt; Const(x * y)
    case (x, Const(1)) =&gt; x
    case (Const(1), y) =&gt; x
    case _ =&gt; super.infix_*(x, y)
  }
}
trait ArithExpOptFFT extends ArithExp {
  override def infix_*(x:Exp[Double],y:Exp[Double]) = (x,y) match {
    case (Const(k), Def(Times(Const(l), y))) =&gt; Const(k * l) * y
    case (x, Def(Times(Const(k), y))) =&gt; Const(k) * (x * y))
    case (Def(Times(Const(k), x)), y) =&gt; Const(k) * (x * y))
    ...
    case (x, Const(y)) =&gt; Const(y) * x
    case _ =&gt; super.infix_*(x, y)
  }
}
</code></pre>
<p>Note that the trait linearization order defines the rewriting strategy. We
<br  />still maintain our guarantee that no <code>Times</code> node could be rewritten further.</p>

<br  />traits and corresponding optimizations.</p>
<h2>Context- and Flow-Sensitive Transformations</h2>
<p>Context and flow sensitive transformation become very important once we
<br  />introduce effects. But even pure functional programs can profit  from context
<br  />information:</p>
<pre><code>if (c) { if (c) a else b } else ...
</code></pre>
<p>The inner test on the same condition is redundant and will always succeed. How
<br  />do we detect this situation? In other cases we can use the Def extractor to
<br  />lookup the definition of a symbol. This will not work here, because Def works
<br  />on Exp input and produces a Def object as output.  We however need to work on
<br  />the level of Exps, turning a Sym into <code>Const(true)</code> based on context
<br  />information.</p>
<p>We need to adapt the way we construct IR nodes. When we enter the then
<br  />branch, we add <code>c$\rightarrow$Const(true)</code> to a substitution. This
<br  />substitution needs to be applied  to arguments of IR nodes constructed within
<br  />the then branch.</p>
<p>One possible solution would be add yet another type constructor, <code>Ref</code>, with
<br  />an implicit conversion from Exp to Ref that applies the substitution. A
<br  />signature like <code>IfThenElse(c: Exp, ...)</code> would become <code>IfThenElse(c: Ref,
&lt;br /&gt;...)</code>. A simpler solution is to implement <code>toAtom</code> in such a way that it
<br  />checks the resulting Def if any of its inputs need substitution and if so
<br  />invoke <code>mirror</code> (see below) on the result  Def, which will apply the
<br  />substitution, call the appropriate smart constructor and finally call <code>toAtom</code>
<br  />again with the transformed result.</p>
<h2>Graph Transformations</h2>
<p>In addition to optimizations performed during graph constructions, we can also
<br  />implement transformation that work directly on the graph structure. This is
<br  />useful if  we need to do analysis on a larger portion of the program first and
<br  />only then apply the transformation. An example would be to find all <code>FooBar</code>
<br  />statements in a graph, and replace them uniformly with <code>BarBaz</code>. All dependent
<br  />statements should re-execute their pattern rewrites, which might trigger on
<br  />the new <code>BarBaz</code> input.</p>
<p>We introduce the concept of <em>mirroring</em>: Given an IR node, we want to apply a
<br  />substitution (or generally, a <code>Transformer</code>) to the arguments and  call the
<br  />appropriate smart constructor again. For every IR node type we require a
<br  />default <code>mirror</code> implementation  that calls back its smart constructor:</p>
<pre><code>override def mirror[A](e: Def[A], f: Transformer): Exp[A] = e match {
  case Plus(a,b) =&gt; f(a) + f(b) // calls infix_+
  case Times(a,b) =&gt; f(a) * f(b)
  case _ =&gt; super.mirror(e,f)
}
</code></pre>
<p>There are some restrictions if we are working directly on the graph level: In
<br  />general we have no (or only limited) context information because a single IR
<br  />node may occur multiple times in the final program. Thus, attempting to
<br  />simplify effectful or otherwise context-dependent expressions will produce
<br  />wrong results  without an appropriate context. For pure expressions, a smart
<br  />constructor called from <code>mirror</code> should not  create new symbols apart from the
<br  />result and it should not call reifyBlock.  Otherwise, if we were creating new
<br  />symbols when  nothing changes, the returned symbol could not be used to check
<br  />convergence of an iterative transformation easily.</p>
<p>The <code>Transfomer</code> argument to <code>mirror</code> can be
<br  />queried to find out whether <code>mirror</code> is allowed to call context
<br  />dependent methods:</p>
<pre><code>override def mirror[A](e: Def[A], f: Transformer): Exp[A] = e match {
  case IfThenElse(c,a,b) =&gt;
    if (f.hasContext)
      __ifThenElse(f(c),f.reflectBlock(a),f.reflectBlock(b))
    else
      ifThenElse(f(c),f(a),f(b)) // context-free version
  case _ =&gt; super.mirror(e,f)
}
</code></pre>
<p>If the context is guaranteed to be set up correctly, we call the regular smart
<br  />constructor and use <code>f.reflectBlock</code> to call mirror recursively on the
<br  />contents of blocks <code>a</code> and <code>b</code>.  Otherwise, we call a more restricted context
<br  />free method.</p>
<h2>Dead Code Elimination</h2>
<p>Dead code elimination can be performed purely on the graph level, simply by
<br  />finding all statements  reachable from the final result and discarding
<br  />everything else.</p>
<p>We define a method to find all symbols a given object references directly:</p>
<pre><code>def syms(x: Any): List[Sym[Any]]
</code></pre>
<p>If <code>x</code> is a Sym itself, <code>syms(x)</code> will return <code>List(x)</code>. For a case class
<br  />instance  that implements the <code>Product</code> interface such as <code>Times(a,b)</code>, it
<br  />will return <code>List(a,b)</code> if both <code>a</code> and <code>b</code> are Syms. Since the argument type
<br  />is <code>Any</code>, we can apply <code>syms</code> not  only to Def objects directly but also to
<br  />lists of Defs, for example.</p>
<p>Then, assuming <code>R</code> is the final program result, the set of remaining symbols
<br  />in the  graph <code>G</code> is the least fixpoint of:</p>
<pre><code>G = R $\cup$ syms(G map findDefinition)
</code></pre>
<p>Dead code elimination will discard all other nodes.</p>
<h1>From Graphs Back to Trees</h1>
<p>To turn program graphs back into trees for code generation we have to decide
<br  />which graph nodes should go where in the resulting program. This is the task
<br  />of code motion.</p>
<h2>Code Motion</h2>
<p>\label{sec:320codemotion}</p>
<p>Other optimizations can apply transformations optimistically and need not
<br  />worry  about maintaining a correct schedule: Code motion will fix it up.  The
<br  />algorithm will try to push statements inside conditional branches and hoist
<br  />statements out of loops. Code motion depends on dependency and frequency
<br  />information but not directly on data-flow information. Thus it can treat
<br  />functions or other user defined compound statements in the same way as loops.
<br  />This makes  our algorithm different from code motion algorithms based on data
<br  />flow  analysis such as Lazy Code Motion (LCM, <a href="DBLP:conf/pldi/KnoopRS92">(*)</a>)
<br  />or Partial Redundancy Elimination (PRE, <a href="DBLP:journals/toplas/KennedyCLLTC99">(*)</a>).</p>
<p>The graph IR reflects ''must before'' (ordering) and ''must inside''
<br  />(containment) relations, as well as anti-dependence and frequency. These
<br  />relations are implemented by the following methods, which can be overridden
<br  />for new definition classes:</p>
<pre><code>def syms(e: Any): List[Sym[Any]]        // value dependence (must before)
def softSyms(e: Any): List[Sym[Any]]    // anti dependence (must not after)
def boundSyms(e: Any): List[Sym[Any]]   // nesting dependence (must not outside)
def symsFreq(e: Any): List[(Sym[Any],   // frequency information (classify
  Double)]                              // sym as 'hot', 'normal', 'cold')
</code></pre>
<p>To give an example, <code>boundSyms</code> applied to a loop node
<br  /><code>RangeForeach(range,idx,body)</code> with index variable <code>idx</code> would return
<br  /><code>List(idx)</code> to denote that <code>idx</code> is fixed ''inside'' the loop expression.</p>
<p>Given a subgraph and a list of result nodes, the goal is to identify the graph
<br  />nodes that should form the ''current'' level, as opposed to those that should
<br  />remain in some ''inner'' scope, to be scheduled later. We will reason about
<br  />the paths on which statements can be reached from the result. The first idea
<br  />is to retain all nodes on the current level that are reachable on a path that
<br  />does not cross any conditionals, i.e. that has no ''cold'' refs. Nodes only
<br  />used from conditionals will be pushed down. However, this approach does not
<br  />yet reflect the precedence of loops. If a loop is top-level,  then
<br  />conditionals inside the loop (even if deeply nested) should not prevent
<br  />hoisting of statements. So we refine the characterization to retain all nodes
<br  />that are reachable on a path that does not cross top-level conditionals.</p>
<p>\begin{figure}
<br  />\begin{center}
<br  />\includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{fig_graph_nesting.pdf}
<br  />\end{center}
<br  />\caption{\label{fig:codemotion}Graph IR with regular and nesting edges (boundSyms, dotted line) as
<br  />used for code motion.}
<br  />\end{figure}</p>
<p>This leads to a simple iterative algorithm: Starting with the known top level
<br  />statements, nodes reachable via normal links are added and for each hot ref,
<br  />we follow nodes that are forced inside until we reach one that can become top-
<br  />level again.</p>
<p>Code Motion Algorithm: Compute the set $L$ of top level statements for the
<br  />current block, from a set of available statements $E$, a set of forced-inside
<br  />statements $G \subseteq E$ and a block result $R$.</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Start with $L$ containing the known top level statements, initially the
<br  />(available) block result $R \cap E$.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Add to $L$ all nodes reachable from $L$ via normal links (neither hot nor
<br  />cold) through $E-G$ (not forced inside).</p>
</li>
<li><p>For each hot ref from $L$ to a statement in $E-L$, follow any links through
<br  />$G$, i.e. the nodes that are forced inside, if there are any. The first
<br  />non-forced-inside nodes (the ''hot fringe'') become top level as well
<br  />(add to $L$).</p>
</li>
<li><p>Continue with 2 until a fixpoint is reached.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>To implement this algorithm, we need to determine the set <code>G</code> of nodes that
<br  />are forced inside and may not be part of the top level.  We start with the
<br  />block result <code>R</code> and a graph <code>E</code> that has all unnecessary  nodes removed (DCE
<br  />already performed):</p>
<pre><code>E = R $\cup$ syms(E map findDefinition)
</code></pre>
<p>We then need a way to find all uses of a given symbol <code>s</code>, up to but not
<br  />including the node where the symbol is bound:</p>
<pre><code>U(s) = {s} $\cup$ { g $\in$ E | syms(findDefinition(g)) $\cap$ U(s) $\ne\emptyset$
                  &amp;&amp; s $\notin$ boundSyms(findDefinition(g))) }
</code></pre>
<p>We collect all bound symbols and their dependencies. These cannot live on the
<br  />current level, they are forced inside:</p>
<pre><code>B = boundSyms (E map findDefinition)
G = union (B map U)    // must inside
</code></pre>
<p>Computing <code>U(s)</code> for many symbols <code>s</code> individually is costly but
<br  />implementations can exploit considerable sharing to optimize the computation
<br  />of <code>G</code>.</p>
<p>The iteration above uses <code>G</code> to follow forced-inside  nodes after a hot ref
<br  />until a node is found that can be moved to the top level.</p>
<p>Let us consider a few examples to build some intuition about the code motion
<br  />behavior. In the code below, the starred conditional is on the fringe (first
<br  />statement that can be outside) and on a hot path (through the loop). Thus it
<br  />will be hoisted. Statement <code>foo</code> will be moved inside:</p>
<pre><code>loop { i =&gt;                z = if* (x) foo
  if (i &gt; 0)               loop { i =&gt;
    if* (x)                  if (i &gt; 0)
      foo                      z
}                          }
</code></pre>
<p>The situation changes if the inner conditional is forced inside by a value
<br  />dependency.  Now statement <code>foo</code> is on the hot fringe and becomes top level.</p>
<pre><code>loop { i =&gt;                z = foo*
  if (x)                   loop { i =&gt;
    if (i &gt; 0)               if (x)
      foo*                     if (i &gt; 0)
}                                z
                           }
</code></pre>
<p>For loops inside conditionals, the containing statements will be moved inside
<br  />(relative to the current level).</p>
<pre><code>if (x)                     if (x)
  loop { i =&gt;                z = foo
    foo                      loop { i =&gt;
  }                            z
                             }
</code></pre>
<h3>Pathological Cases</h3>
<p>The described algorithm works well and is reasonably efficient in practice.
<br  />Being a heuristic, it cannot be optimal in all cases. Future versions could
<br  />employ more elaborate cost models instead of the simple hot/cold distinction.
<br  />One case worth mentioning is when a  statement is used only in conditionals
<br  />but in different conditionals:</p>
<pre><code>z = foo                    if (x)
if (x)                       foo
  z                        if (y)
if (y)                       foo
  z
</code></pre>
<p>In this situation <code>foo</code> will be duplicated. Often this duplication is
<br  />beneficial because <code>foo</code> can be optimized together with other statements
<br  />inside  the branches. In general of course there is a danger of slowing down
<br  />the program if both conditions are likely to be true at the same time. In that
<br  />case it would be a good idea anyways to restructure the program to factor out
<br  />the common criteria into a separate test.</p>
<h3>Scheduling</h3>
<p>Once we have determined which statements should occur on which level, we have
<br  />to come up with an ordering for the statements. Before starting the code
<br  />motion algorithm, we sort the input graph in topological order and we will use
<br  />the same order for the final result. For the purpose of sorting, we include
<br  />anti-dependencies in the topological sort although they are disregarded during
<br  />dead code elimination.  A bit of care must be taken though: If we introduce
<br  />loops or recursive  functions the graph can be cyclic, in which case no
<br  />topological order exists. However, cycles are caused only by inner nodes
<br  />pointing back to outer nodes and for sorting purposes we can remove these
<br  />back-edges to obtain an acyclic graph.</p>
<h2>Tree-Like Traversals and Transformers</h2>
<p>To generate code or to perform transformation by iterated staging (see
<br  /><a href="#sec:310treeTrans">above</a>) we need to turn our graph back into a tree. The
<br  />interface to code motion allows us to build a generic tree-like traversal over
<br  />our graph structure:</p>
<pre><code>trait Traversal {
  val IR: Expressions; import IR._
  // perform code motion, maintaining current scope
  def focusExactScope(r: Exp[Any])(body: List[Stm[Any]] =&gt; A): A
  // client interface
  def traverseBlock[T](b: Block[T]): Unit =
    focusExactScope(b.res) { levelScope =&gt;
      levelScope.foreach(traverseStm)
    }
  def traverseStm[T](s: Stm[T]): Unit = blocks(s).foreach(traverseBlock)
}
</code></pre>
<p>This is useful for other analyses as well, but in particular for building
<br  />transformers that traverse one graph in a tree like fashion and create another
<br  />graph analogous to the appraoach above <a href="#sec:310treeTrans">above</a>. The
<br  />implementation of trait <code>ForwardTransformer</code> carries over almost unmodified.</p>
<h1>Effects</h1>
<p>\label{sec:321}</p>
<p>To ensure that operations can be safely moved around (and for other
<br  />optimizations as well), a compiler needs to reason about their possible side
<br  />effects. The graph representation presented so far is pure and does not
<br  />mention effects at all. However all the necessary ingredients are already
<br  />there: We can keep track of side effects simply by making  effect dependencies
<br  />explicit in the graph. In essence, we turn all programs into functional
<br  />programs by adding an invisible state parameter (similar in spirit but not
<br  />identical to SSA conversion).</p>
<h2>Simple Effect Domain</h2>
<p>We first consider global effects like console output via <code>println</code>.
<br  />Distinguishing only between ''has no effect'' and ''may have effect'' means
<br  />that all operations on mutable data structures,  including reads, have to be
<br  />serialized along with all other side effects.</p>
<p>By default, we assume operations to be pure (i.e. side-effect free).
<br  />Programmers can designate effectful operations by using <code>reflectEffect</code>
<br  />instead of the implicit conversion <code>toAtom</code> which internally delegates to
<br  /><code>reflectPure</code>. Console output, for example, is implemented like this:</p>
<pre><code>def print(x: Exp[String]): Exp[Unit] = reflectEffect(Print(x))
</code></pre>
<p>The call to <code>reflectEffect</code> adds the passed IR node to a list of effects for
<br  />the  current block. Effectful expressions will attract dependency edges
<br  />between them to  ensure serialization.  A compound expression such as a loop
<br  />or a conditional will internally use <code>reifyBlock</code>, which attaches nesting
<br  />edges to the effectful nodes contained in the block.</p>
<p>Internally, <code>reflectEffect</code> creates <code>Reflect</code> nodes that keep track of the
<br  />context dependencies:</p>
<pre><code>var context: List[Exp[Any]]
case class Reflect[T](d: Def[T], es: List[Sym[Any]]) extends Def[T]
def reflectEffect[T](d: Def[T]): Exp[T] = createDefinition(Reflect(d, context)).sym
</code></pre>
<p>The context denotes the ''current state''. Since state can be seen as an
<br  />abstraction of effect history, we just define context as a list of the
<br  />previous effects.</p>
<p>In this simple model, all effect dependencies are uniformly encoded in the IR
<br  />graph.  Rewriting, CSE, DCE, and Code Motion are disabled for effectful
<br  />statements (very pessimistic). Naturally we would like something more  fine
<br  />grained for mutable data.</p>
<h2>Fine Grained Effects: Tracking Mutations per Allocation Site</h2>
<p>We can add other, more fine grained, variants of <code>reflectEffect</code> which allow
<br  />tracking mutations per allocation site or other, more general abstractions of
<br  />the heap that provide a partitioning into regions. Aliasing and sharing of
<br  />heap objects such as arrays can be tracked via optional annotations on IR
<br  />nodes. Reads and writes of mutable objects are automatically serialized and
<br  />appropriate dependencies inserted to guarantee a legal execution schedule.</p>
<p>Effectful statements are tagged with an effect summary that further describes
<br  />the effect. The summary can be extracted via <code>summarizeEffects</code>, and  there
<br  />are some operations on summaries (like <code>orElse</code>, <code>andThen</code>) to  combine
<br  />effects. As an example consider the definition of conditionals, which computes
<br  />the compound effect from the effects of the two branches:</p>
<pre><code>def __ifThenElse[T](cond: Exp[Boolean], thenp: =&gt; Rep[T], elsep: =&gt; Rep[T]) {
  val a = reifyBlock(thenp)
  val b = reifyBlock(elsep)
  val ae = summarizeEffects(a) // get summaries of the branches
  val be = summarizeEffects(b)
  val summary = ae orElse be   // compute summary for whole expression
  reflectEffect(IfThenElse(cond, a, b), summary)  // reflect compound expression
                                                  // (effect might be none, i.e. pure)
}
</code></pre>
<p>To specify effects more precisely for different kinds of IR nodes, we add
<br  />further <code>reflect</code> methods:</p>
<pre><code>reflectSimple     // a 'simple' effect: serialized with other simple effects
reflectMutable    // an allocation of a mutable object; result guaranteed unique
reflectWrite(v)   // a write to v: must refer to a mutable allocation
                  // (reflectMutable IR node)
reflectRead(v)    // a read of allocation v (not used by programmer,
                  // inserted implicitly)
reflectEffect(s)  // provide explicit summary s, specify may/must info for
                  // multiple reads/writes
</code></pre>
<p>The framework will serialize reads and writes so to respect data and anti-
<br  />dependency with respect  to the referenced allocations. To make this work we
<br  />also need to keep track of sharing and  aliasing. Programmers can provide for
<br  />their IR nodes  a list of input expressions which the result of the IR node
<br  />may  alias, contain, extract from or copy from.</p>
<pre><code>def aliasSyms(e: Any): List[Sym[Any]]
def containSyms(e: Any): List[Sym[Any]]
def extractSyms(e: Any): List[Sym[Any]]
def copySyms(e: Any): List[Sym[Any]]
</code></pre>
<p>These four pieces of information correspond to the possible pointer
<br  />operations <code>x = y</code>, <code>*x = y</code>, <code>x = *y</code> and <code>*x = *y</code>.  Assuming an operation
<br  /><code>y = Foo(x)</code>, <code>x</code> should be returned in the following cases:</p>
<pre><code>x $\in$ aliasSyms(y)      if y = x      // if then else
x $\in$ containSyms(y)    if *y = x     // array update
x $\in$ extractSyms(y)    if y = *x     // array apply
x $\in$ copySyms(y)       if *y = *x    // array clone
</code></pre>
<p>Here, <code>y = x</code> is understood as ''y may be equal to x'',  <code>*y = x</code> as
<br  />''dereferencing y (at some index) may return x'' etc.</p>
<h3>Restricting Possible Effects</h3>
<p>It is often useful to restrict the allowed effects somewhat to make analysis
<br  />more tractable and provide better optimizations. One model, which works
<br  />reasonably well for many applications,  is to prohibit sharing and aliasing
<br  />between mutable objects. Furthermore, read and write operations must
<br  />unambiguously identify the allocation site of the object being  accessed. The
<br  />framework uses the aliasing and points-to information to enforce these rules
<br  />and to keep track of immutable objects that  point to mutable data. This is to
<br  />make sure the right serialization  dependencies and <code>reflectRead</code> calls are
<br  />inserted for operations that may reference mutable state in an indirect way.</p>
<h1>(Chapter 3) Advanced Optimizations</h1>
<p>\label{chap:330opt}</p>
<p>We have seen <a href="#chap:320graphs">above</a> how many classic compiler  optimizations
<br  />can be applied to the IR generated from embedded programs  in a
<br  />straightforward way.  Due to the structure of the IR, these optimizations all
<br  />operate in an essentially global way, at the level of domain operations. In
<br  />this chapter we discuss some other advanced optimizations that can be
<br  />implemented on the graph IR. We present more elaborate examples for how these
<br  />optimizations benefit  larger use cases later.</p>
<h1>Rewriting</h1>
<p>Many optimizations that are traditionally implemented using an iterative
<br  />dataflow analysis followed by a transformation pass can also be expressed
<br  />using various flavors of rewriting. Whenever possible we tend to prefer the
<br  />rewriting version because rewrite rules are easy to specify separately and do
<br  />not require programmers to define  abstract interpretation lattices.</p>
<h2>Context-Sensitive Rewriting</h2>
<p>Smart constructors in our graph IR can be context sensitive. For example,
<br  />reads of local variables examine the current effect context to find the last
<br  />assignment, implementing a form of copy propagation (middle):</p>
<pre><code>var x = 7     var x = 7    println(5)
x = 5         x = 5
println(x)    println(5)
</code></pre>
<p>This renders the stores dead, and they will be removed by dead code
<br  />elimination later (right).</p>
<h2>Speculative Rewriting: Combining Analyses and Transformations</h2>
<p>Many optimizations are mutually beneficial.  In the presence of loops,
<br  />optimizations need to make optimistic assumptions for the supporting analysis
<br  />to obtain best results.  If multiple analyses are run separately, each of them
<br  />effectively makes pessimistic assumptions about the outcome of all others.
<br  />Combined analyses avoid the phase ordering problem by solving everything at
<br  />the same time. Lerner, Grove, and Chambers showed a method of composing
<br  />optimizations by interleaving analyses and transformations
<br  /><a href="lerner02composingdataflow">(*)</a>.  We use a modified version of their
<br  />algorithm that works on structured loops instead of CFGs and using dependency
<br  />information and rewriting instead of explicit data flow lattices. Usually,
<br  />rewriting is semantics preserving, i.e. pessimistic. The idea is to drop that
<br  />assumption. As a corollary, we need to rewrite speculatively and be able to
<br  />rollback to a previous state to get optimistic optimization. The algorithm
<br  />proceeds as follows: for each encountered loop, apply all possible transforms
<br  />to the loop body, given empty initial assumptions.  Analyze the result of the
<br  />transformation: if any new information is discovered throw away the
<br  />transformed loop body and retransform the original with updated assumptions.
<br  />Repeat until the analysis result has reached a fixpoint and keep the last
<br  />transformation as result.</p>
<p>Here is an example of speculative rewriting, showing the initial optimistic
<br  />iteration (middle), with the fixpoint (right) reached after the second
<br  />iteration:</p>
<pre><code>var x = 7                 var x = 7          var x = 7 //dead
var c = 0                 var c = 0          var c = 0
while (c &lt; 10) {          while (true) {     while (c &lt; 10) {
  if (x &lt; 10) print("!")    print("!")         print("!")
  else x = c                print(7)           print(7)
  print(x)                  print(0)           print(c)
  print(c)                  c = 1              c += 1
  c += 1                  }                  }
}
</code></pre>
<p>This algorithm allows us to do all forward data flow analyses and transforms
<br  />in one uniform, combined pass driven by rewriting. In the example above,
<br  />during the initial  iteration (middle), separately specified rewrites for
<br  />variables and conditionals work together to  determine that <code>x=c</code> is never
<br  />executed. At the end of the loop body we discover the write to <code>c</code>, which
<br  />invalidates our initial optimistic assumption <code>c=0</code>.  We rewrite the original
<br  />body again with the augmented information (right).  This time there is no
<br  />additional knowledge discovered so the last speculative rewrite becomes the
<br  />final one.</p>
<h2>Delayed Rewriting and Multi-Level IR</h2>
<p>\label{sec:330delayed}</p>
<p>For some transformations, e.g. data structure representation lowering, we do
<br  />not execute rewrites now, but later, to give further immediate rewrites a
<br  />change to match on the current expression before it is rewritten. This is a
<br  />simple form of prioritizing different rewrites, in this case optimizations
<br  />over lowerings. It also happens to be a central idea behind telescoping
<br  />languages <a href="kennedy05telescoping">(*)</a>.</p>
<p>We perform simplifications eagerly, after each transform phase. Thus we
<br  />guarantee that CSE, DCE etc. have been applied on high-level operations before
<br  />they are translated into lower-level equivalents, on which optimizations would
<br  />be much harder to apply.</p>
<p>We call the mechanism to express this form of rewrites <em>delayed</em> rewriting.
<br  />Here is an example that delayedly  transforms a plus operation on Vectors into
<br  />an operation on arrays:</p>
<pre><code>def infix_plus(a: Rep[Vector[Double]], b: Rep[Vector[Double]]) = {
  VectorPlus(a,b) atPhase(lowering) {
    val data = Array.fill(a.length) { i =&gt; a(i) + b(i) }
    vector_with_backing_array(data)
  }
}
</code></pre>
<p>The transformation is only carried out at phase <code>lowering</code>. Before that, the
<br  />IR node remains a <code>VectorPlus</code> node, which allows other smart constructor
<br  />rewrites to kick in that   match their arguments against <code>VectorPlus</code>.</p>
<p>Technically, delayed rewriting is implemented using a worklist transformer
<br  />that keeps track of the rewrites to be performed during the next iteration.
<br  />The added convenience over using a transformer directly is that programmers
<br  />can define simple lowerings inline without needing to subclass and install a
<br  />transformer trait.</p>
<h1>Splitting and Combining Statements</h1>
<p>Since our graph IR contains structured expressions, optimizations need to
<br  />work with compound statements. Reasoning about compound statements is not
<br  />easy: For example, our simple dead code elimination algorithm will not  be
<br  />able to remove only pieces of a compound expression. Our solution is simple
<br  />yet effective: We eagerly split many kinds of compound statements, assuming
<br  />optimistically that only parts will be needed. We find out which parts through
<br  />the regular DCE algorithm. Afterwards we reassemble the remaining pieces.</p>
<h2>Effectful Statements</h2>
<p>A good example of statement splitting are effectful conditionals:</p>
<pre><code>var a, b, c = ...      var a, b, c = ...      var a, c = ...
if (cond) {            if (cond)              if (cond)
  a = 9                  a = 9                  a = 9
  b = 1                if (cond)              else
} else                   b = 1                  c = 3
  c = 3                if (!cond)             println(a+c)
println(a+c)             c = 3
                       println(a+c)
</code></pre>
<p>From the conditional in the initial program (left), splitting creates three
<br  />separate expressions, one for each referenced variable (middle). Pattern
<br  />rewrites are executed when building the split nodes but do not have any effect
<br  />here. Dead code elimination removes the middle one because variable b is not
<br  />used, and the remaining conditionals are merged back together (right). Of
<br  />course successful merging requires to keep track of how expressions have been
<br  />split.</p>
<h2>Data Structures</h2>
<p>\label{sec:361struct}</p>
<p>Splitting is also very effective for data structures, as often only parts of a
<br  />data structure are used or modified. We can define a generic framework for
<br  />data structures:</p>
<pre><code>trait StructExp extends BaseExp {
  abstract class StructTag
  case class Struct[T](tag: StructTag, elems: Map[String,Rep[Any]]) extends Def[T]
  case class Field[T](struct: Rep[Any], key: String) extends Def[T]

  def struct[T](tag: StructTag, elems: Map[String,Rep[Any]]) = Struct(tag, elems)
  def field[T](struct: Rep[Any], key: String): Rep[T] = struct match {
    case Def(Struct(tag, elems)) =&gt; elems(index).asInstanceOf[Rep[T]]
    case _ =&gt; Field[T](struct, index)
  }
}
</code></pre>
<p>There are two IR node types, one for structure creation and one for field
<br  />access. The structure creation node contains a hash map that holds (static)
<br  />field identifiers and (dynamic) field values. It also contains a <code>tag</code> that
<br  />can be used to hold further information about the nature of the data
<br  />structure. The interface for field accesses is method <code>field</code>, which pattern
<br  />matches on its argument and, if that is a <code>Struct</code> creation, looks up the
<br  />desired value from the embedded hash map.</p>
<p>We continue by adding a rule that makes the result of a conditional a
<br  /><code>Struct</code> if the branches return <code>Struct</code>:</p>
<pre><code>override def ifThenElse[T](cond: Rep[Boolean], a: Rep[T], b: Rep[T]) =
(a,b) match {
  case (Def(Struct(tagA,elemsA)), Def(Struct(tagB, elemsB))) =&gt;
    assert(tagA == tagB)
    assert(elemsA.keySet == elemsB.keySet)
    Struct(tagA, elemsA.keySet map (k =&gt; ifThenElse(cond, elemsA(k), elemsB(k))))
  case _ =&gt; super.ifThenElse(cond,a,b)
}
</code></pre>
<p>Similar rules are added for many of the other core IR node types. DCE can
<br  />remove individual elements of the data structure that are never used. During
<br  />code generation and tree traversals, the remaining parts of the  split
<br  />conditional are merged back together.</p>
<p>We will study examples of this struct abstraction <a href="#sec:455struct">here</a> and
<br  />an extension to unions and inheritance in <a href="#sec:455inherit">here</a>.</p>
<h2>Representation Conversion</h2>
<p>\label{sec:360soa}</p>
<p>A natural extension of this mechanism is a generic array-of-struct to struct-
<br  />of-array transform.  The definition is analogous to that of conditionals. We
<br  />override the array constructor <code>arrayFill</code>  that represents expressions of the
<br  />form \c|Array.fill(n) { i => body }| to create a struct with an array for each
<br  />component of the body if the body itself is a Struct:</p>
<pre><code>override def arrayFill[T](size: Exp[Int], v: Sym[Int], body: Def[T]) = body match {
  case Block(Def(Struct(tag, elems))) =&gt;
    struct[T](ArraySoaTag(tag,size),
      elems.map(p =&gt; (p._1, arrayFill(size, v, Block(p._2)))))
  case _ =&gt; super.arrayFill(size, v, body)
}
</code></pre>
<p>Note that we tag the result struct with an <code>ArraySoaTag</code> to keep track of the
<br  />transformation. This class is defined as follows:</p>
<pre><code>case class ArraySoaTag(base: StructTag, len: Exp[Int]) extends StructTag
</code></pre>
<p>We also override the methods that are used to access array elements and return
<br  />the length of an array to do the right thing for transformed arrays:</p>
<pre><code>override def infix_apply[T](a: Rep[Array[T]], i: Rep[Int]) = a match {
  case Def(Struct(ArraySoaTag(tag,len),elems)) =&gt;
    struct[T](tag, elems.map(p =&gt; (p._1, infix_apply(p._2, i))))
  case _ =&gt; super.infix_at(a,i)
}
override def infix_length[T](a: Rep[Array[T]]): Rep[Int] = a match {
  case Def(Struct(ArraySoaTag(tag, len), elems)) =&gt; len
  case _ =&gt; super.infix_length(a)
}
</code></pre>
<p>Examples for this struct of array transformation are shown in
<br  /><a href="#sec:455structUse">here</a> and <a href="#chap:460fusionUse">here</a>.</p>
<h1>Loop Fusion and Deforestation</h1>
<p>\label{sec:360fusionComp}</p>
<p>The use of independent and freely composable traversal operations such as
<br  /><code>v.map(..).sum</code> is preferable to explicitly coded loops. However, naive
<br  />implementations of these operations would be expensive and entail lots of
<br  />intermediate data structures.  We provide a novel loop fusion algorithm for
<br  />data parallel loops and traversals (see <a href="#chap:460fusionUse">here</a> for
<br  />examples of use). The core loop abstraction is</p>
<pre><code>loop(s) $\overline{\mathtt{{x=}}\G}$ { i =&gt; $\overline{E[ \mathtt{x} \yield \mathtt{f(i)} ]}$ }
</code></pre>
<p>where <code>s</code> is the size of the loop and <code>i</code> the loop variable ranging over
<br  />$[0,\mathtt{s})$. A loop can compute multiple results $\overline{\mathtt{x}}$,
<br  />each of which is associated with a generator $\G$, one of <code>Collect</code>, which
<br  />creates a flat array-like data structure, <code>Reduce($\oplus$)</code>, which reduces
<br  />values with the associative operation $\oplus$, or <code>Bucket($\G$)</code>, which
<br  />creates a nested data structure, grouping generated values by key and applying
<br  />$\G$ to those with matching key. Loop bodies consist of yield statements <code>x
&lt;br /&gt;$\yield$ f(i)</code> that define values passed to generators (of this loop or an
<br  />outer loop), embedded in some outer context $E[.]$ that might consist of other
<br  />loops or conditionals. For <code>Bucket</code> generators yield takes (key,value) pairs.</p>
<p>The fusion rules are summarized below:</p>
<pre><code>Generator kinds: $\mathcal{G} ::= $ `Collect` $|$ `Reduce($\oplus$)` $|$ `Bucket($\mathcal{G`$)} \\
Yield statement: xs $\yield$ x \\
Contexts: $E[.] ::= $ loops and conditionals

Horizontal case (for all types of generators):

   loop(s) x1=$\G_1$ { i1 =&gt; $E_1[$ x1 $\yield$ f1(i1) $]$ }
   loop(s) y1=$\G_2$ { i2 =&gt; $E_2[$ x2 $\yield$ f2(i2) $]$ }
---------------------------------------------------------------------
 loop(s) x1=$\G_1$, x2=$\G_2$ { i =&gt;
          $E_1[$ x1 $\yield$ f1(i) $]$; $E_2[$ x2 $\yield$ f2(i) $]$ }

Vertical case (consume collect):

  loop(s) x1=Collect { i1 =&gt; $E_1[$ x1 $\yield$ f1(i1) $]$ }
loop(x1.size) x2=$\G$ { i2 =&gt; $E_2[$ x2 $\yield$ f2(x1(i2)) $]$ }
---------------------------------------------------------------------
</code></pre>
<p>loop(s) x1=Collect, x2=$\G$ { i =></p>
<pre><code>            $E_1[$ x1 $\yield$ f1(i); $E_2[$ x2 $\yield$ f2(f1(i)) $]]$ }

Vertical case (consume bucket collect):

        loop(s) x1=Bucket(Collect) { i1 =&gt;
            $E_1[$ x1 $\yield$ (k1(i1), f1(i1)) $]$ }
  loop(x1.size) x2=Collect { i2 =&gt;
    loop(x1(i2).size) y=$\G$ { j =&gt;
      $E_2[$ y $\yield$ f2(x1(i2)(j)) $]$ }; x2 $\yield$ y }
---------------------------------------------------------------------
loop(s) x1=Bucket(Collect), x2=Bucket($\G$) { i =&gt;
    $E_1[$ x1 $\yield$ (k1(i), f1(i));
        $E_2[$ x2 $\yield$ (k1(i), f2(f1(i))) $]]$ }
</code></pre>
<p>This model is expressive enough to model many common collection operations:</p>
<pre><code>x=v.map(f)     loop(v.size) x=Collect { i =&gt; x $\yield$ f(v(i)) }
x=v.sum        loop(v.size) x=Reduce(+) { i =&gt;  x $\yield$ v(i) }
x=v.filter(p)  loop(v.size) x=Collect { i =&gt; if (p(v(i)))
                                                x $\yield$ v(i) }
x=v.flatMap(f) loop(v.size) x=Collect { i =&gt; val w = f(v(i))
                         loop(w.size) { j =&gt; x $\yield$ w(j) }}
x=v.distinct   loop(v.size) x=Bucket(Reduce(rhs)) { i =&gt;
                                        x $\yield$ (v(i), v(i)) }
</code></pre>
<p>Other operations are accommodated by generalizing slightly. Instead of
<br  />implementing a <code>groupBy</code> operation that returns a sequence of (Key,
<br  />Seq[Value]) pairs we can return the keys and values in separate data
<br  />structures. The equivalent of <code>(ks,vs)=v.groupBy(k).unzip</code> is:</p>
<pre><code>loop(v.size) ks=Bucket(Reduce(rhs)),vs=Bucket(Collect) { i =&gt;
  ks $\yield$ (v(i), v(i)); vs $\yield$ (v(i), v(i)) }
</code></pre>
<p>In the rules above, multiple instances of <code>f1(i)</code> are subject to CSE and not
<br  />evaluated twice. Substituting <code>x1(i2)</code> with <code>f1(i)</code> will remove a reference to
<br  /><code>x1</code>. If <code>x1</code> is not used anywhere else, it will also be subject to DCE.
<br  />Within fused loop bodies, unifying index variable <code>i</code> and substituting
<br  />references will trigger the uniform forward transformation pass. Thus, fusion
<br  />not only removes intermediate data structures but also provides additional
<br  />optimization opportunities inside fused loop bodies (including fusion of
<br  />nested loops).</p>
<p>Fixed size array construction <code>Array(a,b,c)</code> can be expressed as</p>
<pre><code>loop(3) x=Collect { case 0 =&gt; x $\yield$ a
                    case 1 =&gt; x $\yield$ b case 2 =&gt; x $\yield$ c }
</code></pre>
<p>and concatenation <code>xs ++ ys</code> as <code>Array(xs,ys).flatMap(i=&gt;i)</code>:</p>
<pre><code>loop(2) x=Collect { case 0 =&gt; loop(xs.size) { i =&gt; x $\yield$ xs(i) }
                    case 1 =&gt; loop(ys.size) { i =&gt; x $\yield$ ys(i) }}
</code></pre>
<p>Fusing these patterns with a consumer will duplicate the consumer code into
<br  />each match  case. Implementations should have some kind of cutoff value to
<br  />prevent code explosion. Code generation does not need to emit actual loops for
<br  />fixed array constructions but can just produce the right sequencing of yield
<br  />operations.</p>
<p>Examples for the fusion algorithm are shown <a href="#chap:460fusionUse">here</a>.</p>
